## Building and running with Xcode simulator

It is reccommended to run the game using the IOS platform device in Unity, as opposed to the game engine one, as the game is designed to be manouvred with touch functionality.
Make sure you hae the IOS platform downloaded in unity. This can be done from Unity Hub, under Installs.
After cloning the repo, open the game in Unity engine.
Open Build Settings (cmd shift B) and select IOS. Go to you project settings and select "other settings".
Underneath "target SDK", make Simulator SDK is selected. It should be already in the project settings from the pull.

After building, open the hierarchy in Xcode and select unity-iphone. Go to build settings and make sure the ENABLE_BITCODE field is set to 'NO'.

Snequence is then ready to build and run!
We reccommend using a simulator made after 2019, like the iphone 11. :)

## Game concept

Snequence is a combination of the classic games snake and color sequence. The objective of the game is to steer the snake around by swiping the screen to collect the colored orbs.
In order to advance in the game, the snake needs to eat the correct sequence of colors. This sequence is shown at the top of the screen.
