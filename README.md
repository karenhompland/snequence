## Building and running with Xcode simulator

### Testing in Unity

For testing, the game needs to be run using the IOS platform device in Unity, as opposed to the game engine one. This is to accommodate the swiping functionality, and to ensure thecanvas fits the screen. The snake wonÂ´t be able to be swiped if it is not run with a simulator engine. It can also be tested with the Unity Remote 5 app.

### Building

It is truly reccommended to build the game with the IOS platform and test it in Xcode for a better experience. This is due to the dimensions of the game being optimized for mobile screens. 

Make sure you have the IOS platform downloaded in unity. This can be done from Unity Hub, under Installs.
After cloning the repo, open the game in Unity engine.
Open Build Settings (cmd shift B) and select IOS. Go to you project settings and select "other settings". 
Underneath "target SDK", make sure Simulator SDK is selected. (It should be already in the project settings from the pull, but make sure just in case)

After building, open the hierarchy in Xcode and select unity-iphone. Go to build settings and make sure the ENABLE_BITCODE field is set to 'NO'.

Snequence is then ready to build and run!
We reccommend using a simulator made after 2019, like the iphone 11. :)

## Game concept

Snequence is a combination of the classic games snake and color sequence. The objective of the game is to steer the snake around by swiping the screen to collect the colored orbs.
In order to advance in the game, the snake needs to eat the correct sequence of colors. This sequence is shown at the top of the screen.
